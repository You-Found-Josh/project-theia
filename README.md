# Project Theia
UNDP COVID-19 Detect/Protect Challenge

The Theia platform is comprised of a single Theia Smart Contactless Thermometer paired with a single Theia IoT LoRa Hub (although more thermometers can be easily added).  This two-product platform offers both accurate on-the-ground monitoring, as well as a nation-wide observation using LoRa, without a reliance on traditional telecommunication networks (3G/4G, or even WiFi).  The Theia platform effectively allows an exceptionally limited national health service to effectively triage the country, focusing their limited resources on areas where the upward changes in the median average temperature indicates a current viral bloom, offering a low-cost alternative to traditional ‘track & trace’ methods.
